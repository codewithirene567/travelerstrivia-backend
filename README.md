# Traveler's Trivia-backend

## Short description:
Traveler's Trivia - Traveler's Trivia is exactly what it sounds like: a place for travelers to try their hand at some trivia for all the countries they could visit.
Note: If you want to have the front end of the project show on the brower, then this application does need a frontend to be running from another Github repo which is found here: https://github.com/codewithirene567/travelerstrivia-frontend. There are more detailed instructions on that below.

## Install instructions:
1) In your terminal, just copy and paste the following: git clone git@github.com:codewithirene567/travelerstrivia-backend.git.
2) Then type cd travelerstrivia-backend.
3) Type in a command to open the back end file up. Note: If you use Visual Studio Code for your Local Environment type in code .
4) Next run bundle install in the terminal.
5) Then run rails s
6) Copy and paste the link of where the application is running from your terminal into a browser address bar and press enter.

7) The steps up to this point were to show the API on your browser. You'll need to get the front end for this project running as well so that the back-end can show the fetch requests made to it on a web browser. If you only wish to see the API itself then you can skip the listed steps.
- So the first step is to cd out of the back end.  
- Then type git clone git@github.com:codewithirene567/travelerstrivia-frontend.git
- Then type cd travelerstrivia-frontend.
- Type in a command to open the front end file up
- Again if you use Visual Studio Code for your Local Environment type in code .
- Next run bundle install in the terminal.
- Then run open index.html to get the front end of the application to show on the browser.
